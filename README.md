# simple-queue-system-PHP

A method to manage a waiting list by multiple screens through two web pages: the message page with the time and the remote controller to change it.

(Original Readme.md from Rainnic attached)

I forked (as in downloaded) Rainnic's queue system and added some features such as a remote controller to change the waiting list, a message page with the time and a message page with the waiting list, resetting the waiting list with a reset button, and sound!

The only problem is that i cannot use the sound as the main caller as it will only play on the controller. it will not be a problem if the controller is connected to the PA system but it will be if we are using a smartphone as the controller.

I am thus stuck at that point and am unable to further find a solution. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any ideas.
